<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Python-CTCI is my personal attempt to complete each problem in the 6th edition of Cracking the Coding Interview in python. This project was built to promote my own personal growth as well as to help other developers seeking to complete CTCI in python.

This project will supply both the problem, as well as the solution I implemented to complete each problem.

### Built With
